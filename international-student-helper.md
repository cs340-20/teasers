Project Topic:
A mobile web app to allow international students (and students in general) to ask local-specific questions 
to their peers in a university or local community. The goal is to enable students that need specific help
(finding campus resources, help with English, finding good local restaurants, things to do, where to buy products, etc)
to ask it directly to the community around them that might be hard to reach out to otherwise.

We plan to use a PHP backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery, potentially via BootStrap for the userend. 
May eventually distribute through Android and iOS platforms if possible.

Existing Team Members:
Bryceton Bible, Zhekai Dong, Spencer Harper. Potentially open to new members, but not strictly needed.
