Project Topic: Chat Moderator Bot for Instant Messenger service (Discord)

Members: Hudson Doerr, Tristen Finley, Cooper Tue. We are not opposed to adding one more member as long as they have experience using Discord, Python and/or Amazon Web Services.

Technologies: Python, Discord API and Amazon Web Services for hosting.
	Our goal is to build a multi-functional bot that can provide automatic moderation as well as various quality of life functions to a Discord server. Moderating functions would include things such as profanity and spam filters. Quality of life functions are limitless. Some of our ideas so far include: a reminder system, dictionary lookup command, calculator, image/text editing within the app itself. The bot can be hosted anywhere but we will be using AWS EC2 instances for their reliability.
