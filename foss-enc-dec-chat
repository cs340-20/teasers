Project Topic:  While we have not firmly settled on a project topic at this time, 
                we are investigating the feasibility of designing an encrypted,
                decentralized FOSS chat/messaging system.

Need Members?:  We are open to adding a fourth member.

Technologies :  We are investigating the use of EOS blockchain technology to act as
                a decentralized foundation upon which to build the main software
                application.  Early efforts will mostly depend on gpg/openssl/etc.
                libraries for encryption.  If time allows, we may delve into more
                sophisticated implementations.  Currently, we are planning on dev-
                eloping this project in C/C++.  However, as the project is tent-
                ative at this time, the group has also expressed interest in ex-
                ploring other programming languages, as well.  Should time allow,
                alternative languages may be explored in application to this
                project or become a more central focus should we determine that
                the current project idea is not feasible.
